Welcome to the community run MMZ Battle-Forge.


This is a lightweight compilation of save files that you can download and install to get everything you need to play. 

This is a hard fork from Sig's Model Catalogue, and BaconCatBug's Auto installer. But aims to be a decentralized open-source community run project. 

If you're interested in helping maintain this community asset, please send me a direct message to me on discord Malice#1245.

The models included in this file are not 100% complete, but as time goes on we will aim to fill in what is needed.

If you find any issues, please submit an issue in the following format: Type of Issue> Save Game ID Affected > Specific Model if available

Updates will come slowly at first, but as more contributors come online we hope to get everything completed.

**Manual Installation (Windows OS)**
1. Download the Battle-Forge Zip file.
2. Locate your Saves folder under /Your Computer/Documents/My Games/Tabletop Simulator
3. Copy the Battleforged Mod Compilation folder from the Zip and place it inside your Saves folder in your Tabletop Simulator folder
4. Load up the game, make a room, open saves and bingo

**Manual Installation (Mac OS)**

1. Download the Battle-Forge Zip file.
2. Locate your `~/Library/Tabletop Simulator` folder inside your user's home folder.
    - **NOTE** The `~` tilde character means your user's home directory.
    - **NOTE** On MacOS, the `Library` folder might be hidden by default. To unhide, do the following. While in your home folder in Finder, in the menu bar select View -> Show View Options. Then check Show Library Folder. Or you can use the keyboard shortcut by pressing together `cmd`+`shift`+`.` in this folder in Finder.
3. Copy the contents of the Battleforged Mod Pack folder from the Zip in to the `~/Library/Tabletop Simulator/Saves` folder
4. Open your game and room, open your saves

**Manual Installation (Linux)**
1. Download the Battle-Forge Zip file.
2. Locate your Saves file under `/home/<username>/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/.local/share/Tabletop\ Simulator/Saves/` [for the Flatpak installation]
  - If you installed Steam through apt repos on Mint/Ubuntu/Deb file then look under `/home/$USER/.local/share/Tabletop\ Simulator/Saves/` as it won't be 
    sandboxed under `$HOME/.var/[app_name]/`. i.e the directories beneath `/com.valvesoftware.Steam/` emulate what steam would do to your home directory on 
    install.
3. Copy the Battleforged Mod Compilation folder from the Zip and replace and overwrite your Saves folder in your Tabletop Simulator Folder
4. Open your game and room, open your saves

The auto installer is coming soon.
