Welcome to the community run MMZ Battle-Forge.


This is a lightweight compilation of save files that you can download and install to get everything you need to play. 

This is a hard fork from Sig's Model Catalogue, and BaconCatBug's Auto installer. But aims to be a decentralized open-source community run project. 

If you're interested in helping maintain this community asset, please send me a direct message to me on discord Malice#1245.

The models included in this file are not 100% complete, but as time goes on we will aim to fill in what is needed.

If you find any issues, please submit an issue in the following format: Type of Issue> Save Game ID Affected > Specific Model if available

Updates will come slowly at first, but as more contributors come online we hope to get everything completed.

**Manual Installation (Windows OS)**
1. Download the Battle-Forge Zip file.
2. Locate your Saves folder under /Your Computer/Documents/My Games/Tabletop Simulator
3. Copy the Battleforged Mod Compilation folder from the Zip and place it inside your Saves folder in your Tabletop Simulator folder
4. Load up the game, make a room, open saves and bingo

**Manual Installation (Mac OS)**
